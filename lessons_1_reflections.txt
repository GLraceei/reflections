How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can see the lines of code that created the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can go back to fix mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If there is a sudden interruption you'll lose whatever progress made.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For git you may be saving entire folders rather than just one txt doc.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log- shows commit logs. Git diff shows the different lines of code

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Programming projects.
